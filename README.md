# Income-Prediction-using-Neural-Networks
📖 Overview
This project focuses on predicting individual income using a supervised learning regression approach with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The model is built after thorough data preprocessing and is evaluated using standard regression metrics.

🔍 What This Project Covers
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Encoding of categorical variables using one-hot encoding
Feature scaling for neural network optimization
Building and training an ANN using TensorFlow
Model evaluation using MAE, MSE, and RMSE

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python
Pandas, NumPy
TensorFlow / Keras
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib, Seaborn

🎯 Outcome
Developed a neural network model capable of estimating income based on demographic and occupational features, demonstrating practical application of deep learning for regression problems.
